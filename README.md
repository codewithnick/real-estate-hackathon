Objective:
The objective of the fintech-based real estate trading website is to provide a platform for users to add their properties and receive an estimated value of the property, its ROI, and predicted future price trends. The aim is to help users make informed decisions about buying or selling properties based on the predictions provided by the machine learning model.

Methodology:
The real estate trading website will be developed using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Django, and machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn. The website will allow users to add their properties with relevant details such as location, size, amenities, and other relevant information. The website will have a machine learning model that will predict the value of the property based on the data provided by the user.

To build the machine learning model, historical data about property prices and sales will be collected and analyzed. The collected data will be used to train a machine learning algorithm to identify patterns and make predictions about future prices. The model will also consider various factors that may affect the property prices such as location, size, age of the property, and other relevant features.

Results:
The real estate trading website will provide users with an estimated value of their property, its ROI, and predicted future price trends. By using the machine learning model, the website will be able to provide accurate predictions based on historical data, helping users to make informed decisions about buying or selling properties.

In addition, the website can be used by real estate agents and investors to identify undervalued properties that have potential for a high return on investment. The predictions provided by the machine learning model can also help users to plan their investments and financial goals by predicting future prices.

Overall, the fintech-based real estate trading website with machine learning functionality will provide a valuable resource for property buyers, sellers, and investors, helping them to make informed decisions based on accurate and reliable predictions.
